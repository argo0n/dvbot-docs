## Children's Online Privacy

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

Dank Vibes Bot complies with the stipulations set forth by online safety and privacy standards, which include not collecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from individuals under the age of 13. This stance is in alignment with Discord's terms of service, which prohibit users under the age of 13 from creating accounts or accessing the platform. 

If it comes to your attention that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to The Bot, despite the restrictions placed by Discord, we strongly encourage you to reach out to us without delay. Concurrently, we advise reporting this violation to Discord's moderation team to ensure compliance with their policies.

We are committed to taking swift action to remove any such information from our records and to address any concerns related to the protection of children's privacy on the internet. We are dedicated to working within the framework of legal and ethical guidelines to foster a safe online environment for all users.
